# Answer Quality Evaluation Criteria

This document outlines the criteria for manually evaluating the quality of answers generated by the RAG system. Each answer should be scored on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) for each of the following dimensions.

## 1. Relevance (Score: 1-5)

*   **Definition**: Does the answer directly address the user's question?
*   **5 (Excellent)**: The answer is perfectly on-topic and fully addresses the core question.
*   **3 (Moderate)**: The answer addresses the general topic but may miss the specific nuance of the question.
*   **1 (Poor)**: The answer is off-topic or fails to address the question.

## 2. Groundedness / Faithfulness (Score: 1-5)

*   **Definition**: Is the answer fully supported by the provided source documents?
*   **5 (Excellent)**: All claims in the answer are directly supported by the text in the cited sources. There is no hallucinated or invented information.
*   **3 (Moderate)**: Most of the answer is supported by the sources, but there may be minor, unverified claims or slight misinterpretations.
*   **1 (Poor)**: The answer contains significant hallucinated information or contradicts the source material.

## 3. Completeness (Score: 1-5)

*   **Definition**: Does the answer provide a sufficient and comprehensive response?
*   **5 (Excellent)**: The answer is thorough, addresses any implicit sub-questions, and provides necessary context for a full understanding.
*   **3 (Moderate)**: The answer is correct but could be more detailed. It might answer the explicit question but miss underlying context.
*   **1 (Poor)**: The answer is superficial, incomplete, or simply states it doesn't have enough information when the context was actually sufficient.

## 4. Citation Quality (Score: 1-5)

*   **Definition**: Are the citations provided useful and accurate?
*   **5 (Excellent)**: All necessary sources are cited. The cited snippets are highly relevant to the claims being made in the answer.
*   **3 (Moderate)**: Citations are provided, but they may not be the most relevant passages, or some minor claims lack a direct citation.
*   **1 (Poor)**: Citations are missing, irrelevant, or point to the wrong source documents.
